## Overview
Welcome to the Pong Game, a classic gaming experience implemented in Java using Swing. This game pits two players against each other, each controlling a paddle, and your objective is to outmaneuver your opponent by bouncing the ball past their paddle.

## Features

- **Two-Player Action**: Challenge your friends in head-to-head matches, where each player takes control of their paddle using the keyboard.

- **Score Tracking**: Stay in the competition with the built-in score tracking system, ensuring you know who's leading.

- **Rising Tension**: Feel the heat as the ball's speed accelerates after each exhilarating collision with a paddle.

- **Victory Awaits**: The game concludes when one player attains a pre-defined score, making every point and rally crucial.

## How to Play

- **Player 1 (Left Paddle)**: Move your paddle upwards with the `W` key and downwards with the `S` key.

- **Player 2 (Right Paddle)**: Master your opponent by using the `UP` arrow key to raise your paddle and the `DOWN` arrow key to lower it.

## Game Rules

- The game kicks off with the ball at the center of the screen, ready for action.

- Players take turns hitting the ball, maneuvering their paddles up or down to keep the game alive.

- When the ball eludes a player's paddle and exits the screen, their opponent scores a point.

- As the ball repeatedly collides with paddles, its velocity steadily increases, cranking up the challenge.

- The game persists until one player reaches a predetermined score threshold, which can be adjusted in the code to match your preferences.
