## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game in Java using Swing. The game features two paddles and a ball, and your goal is to score points by bouncing the ball past your opponent's paddle.

## Features

○ Two players can play the game, controlling their paddles using the keyboard.
○ The game keeps track of each player's score.
○ The ball's speed increases after each collision with a paddle.
○ The game ends when one player reaches a certain score.


## How to Play

○ Player 1 (Left Paddle): Use the `W` key to move the paddle up and the `S` key to move the paddle down.
○ Player 2 (Right Paddle): Use the `UP` arrow key to move the paddle up and the `DOWN` arrow key to move the paddle down.

## Game Rules

○ The game starts with the ball in the center of the screen.
○ Players take turns hitting the ball by moving their paddles up or down.
○ If the ball passes a player's paddle and goes off the screen, the opposing player scores a point.
○ The ball's speed increases with each collision, making the game more challenging.
○ The game continues until one player reaches a certain score (you can customize this in the code).

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the code in `PongGame.java`. Here are a few things you can do:

○ Change the initial game settings, such as the paddle sizes and ball diameter.
○ Adjust the game's scoring system and winning conditions.
○ Modify the game's appearance by changing colors, fonts, or graphics.
○ Implement additional features or power-ups to make the game more interesting.
